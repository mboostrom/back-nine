Welcome to Back Nine, a golf data app for all skill levels.

When the user navigates to the landing page the user can wither sign in or sign up.
If the user is new to the sight they can sign up and then complete their profile with a first name, last name and profile picture.
When successfully singed up the user is directed to the profile page where they can add a new round to thier time line and start too see the data compile,
the more rounds the user plays the more data they will recieve. If the user does not see the course they played in the add round form they also can add a
course as well.

The user can then visit the find courses page and by searching for a course they can see a satalite image of the course they look up to visualize the course
before they play.
